# 🗃️ Public Assets Repository

Welcome to the public assets repository for my blog. This repository serves as a centralized, organized storage system for hosting static images, diagrams, and site assets, delivered globally via the [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) CDN.

## ⚙️ Image Processing & Performance Standards
To ensure optimal website performance and user experience, all assets in this repository undergo a strict processing workflow before being uploaded:

* **Next-Gen Formats:** Images are converted to `AVIF` or `WebP` formats to provide superior compression and quality compared to traditional JPEGs or PNGs.
* **Manual Optimization:** Assets are compressed using tools like [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) to find the perfect balance between crisp visual quality and minimal file size.
* **Metadata Scrubbing:** Unnecessary EXIF data is stripped from the files to further reduce payload sizes, while preserving relevant copyright/creator tags where legally required.

## ⚖️ Copyright, Licensing, and Attribution
Maintaining intellectual property integrity is a core priority for this project. 

* **Platform-Sourced Content:** We utilize high-quality, open-license content from trusted platforms like [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/), and NASA's Public Domain galleries.
* **Traceability:** While many of these platforms do not strictly require attribution for commercial or personal use, we maintain a "Platform-First Attribution System." 
* **Detailed Credits:** You will find a specific `README.md` inside every category folder (e.g., `/content/physics/README.md`) detailing the source platform for the assets contained within that directory.
